# Use frequency analysis to find the key to ciphertext.txt, and then
# decode it.

# Your code here

'''
- read the ciphertext.txt file and save its information so i can use it
- i will need a dictionairy to store the count of all occurrences for the letters in the cipher text
- i will also need a second dictionary that stores all letters and their respective frequency analysis (this is given to me in the readme)
- i need to intially loop over the text from the ciphertext file and store every occurrence of a letter in the count dictionary - i should ignore punctuation and non letter characters
- after that i need to loop again over the text again this time checking each letter with the count dictionary, i can then use that letters count to calculate the FA (number of occurences / total letters)
- i can then use the letters frequency analysis on the second dictionary to find what the true letter actually is
- i can then replace the letter with the true letter and move on to the next iteration
- i need to skip spaces
- i need to skip non letter characters
- everything is capitalized
- after everything i should save the new text into the cracked file
